# securing-web-api
In this repo, I have developed an app which demonstrate the security of a WEB Api and by extension of that app into an Angular App.

Tools used in the davelopement:
- Node									
- Express				
- Passport					
- CORS(Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)
- MongoDB						
- JWT(JSON Web Token)



---------
Routes:	
---------
https://localhost:8080/api/vehicles. 
- This route is the one, which is secured by JWT and Passport. This routes shows the hard coded data from the file.



https://localhost:8080/api/register
- This route is used for registering new users



https://localhost:8080/api/login
- This reoute is used for login the user, so that the user can be validated.


-------------------
NOTE:
-------------------
- As you can see that I didn't added the views directory, and I dont have the GUI, We can use POSTMAN to user this routes.
- Angular app support is yet to be added. Stay tuned.
